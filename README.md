# Higher or Lower
Simple "Higher or Lower?" card game made using Python's Turtle library.

To run the program, download it and run it using the latest default Python IDE from https://www.python.org/ as the Turtle library is already preinstalled with it. Use the python shell to input commands (usually just 1 or 0).

Assisted mode shows you the statistics for whether the next card is more likely to be higher or lower. The code for admin mode is secret! :)
